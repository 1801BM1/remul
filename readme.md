## International preface
This project contains materials regarding the ancient Soviet chips
of 1801 series. This line presents the package of ULA designs, based
on the same logical matrix chip. The 1801 chips were mass produced
in the 80th of XX century in the USSR and were used mostly within
Soviet PDP-11 clones related products, and were not very popular
or even known at all outside the iron curtain. Nowadays these chips
are interesting for retrocomputing community on the post-Soviet areas
as for former users of Soviet PDP-11 computers. This community mostly
speaks in Russian as native language, so the articles and documents
in this project are written in Russian. If some notable international
interest is found the translations to English may happen. All working
materials (schematics, topologies, HDL sources) are in English.
Please, feel free to contact me with questions and comments.
